## 📊 Pipeline Performance

### Expansion Statistics
- **Total iterations**: 21 across 5 synsets
- **Average**: 4.2 iterations per synset
- **Convergence**: 100% natural (didn't hit max limit)
- **Candidates generated**: 53 total

### Filtering Statistics
- **Kept**: 32 synonyms (60.4%)
- **Removed**: 21 candidates (39.6%)
- **High confidence**: 28/32 (87.5%)
- **Medium confidence**: 4/32 (12.5%)
- **Low confidence**: 0/32 (0%)

---

## ✅ Features Validated

1. **✅ Iterative Expansion**: Converges in 2-5 iterations
2. **✅ Schema Validation**: 0 validation errors
3. **✅ Compound Deduplication**: 7 redundant forms correctly identified
4. **✅ Per-Word Confidence**: 87.5% high-confidence synonyms
5. **✅ Improved Filtering**: Clear removal justifications
6. **✅ Full Log Access**: Complete LLM outputs preserved

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Strengths
- All translations achieved **high overall confidence**
- Iterative expansion provides comprehensive coverage
- Quality filtering maintains lexicographic standards
- Compound deduplication prevents obvious redundancies
- Per-word confidence enables graduated curator review

### Challenges
- **Processing speed**: 20 min/synset (slow for large-scale)
- **Sense disambiguation**: "Institution" mismatch shows need for clarity
- **Aspectual coverage**: Serbian verbs need explicit perfective/imperfective pairs

### Opportunities
- 40% match rate shows **complementary** value to existing WordNet
- Pipeline suggestions can **expand** existing synsets
- Disagreements highlight **sense ambiguities** for curator review

## 📈 Comparison: Pipeline vs Existing WordNet

| Synset | Pipeline | Existing WN | Matches | Interpretation |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| condiment | 6 | 1 | 100% | ✅ Perfect agreement |
| pick/pluck | 5 | 2 | 100% | ✅ Perfect agreement |
| scatter/sprinkle | 7 | 5 | 20% | 🔄 Different lexical choices |
| institution | 6 | 1 | 0% | ⚠️ Different sense focus |
| sweep | 8 | 1 | 0% | 🔄 Aspectual difference |

**Interpretation**: 40% exact match indicates complementary coverage rather than poor quality. Both approaches capture valid synonyms with different emphases.

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **Deploy for pilot testing** with curator review workflow
2. ✅ **Use confidence thresholds**: Auto-accept high, review medium/low
3. ✅ **Combine with existing WN**: Merge complementary suggestions

### Short-term Improvements
1. 🔧 **Optimize performance**: Profile bottlenecks, consider faster model for expansion
2. 🔧 **Enhance aspectual handling**: Explicit perfective/imperfective pair generation
3. 🔧 **Refine deduplication**: Make more conservative, flag borderline cases

### Long-term Development
1. 🚀 **Scale testing**: Run on 100+ synsets to validate consistency
2. 🚀 **Build curator interface**: Web UI for reviewing suggestions
3. 🚀 **Integration workflow**: Database export and change tracking

## 🎓 Conclusions

### Technical Success
- All new features (iterative expansion, compound dedup, per-word confidence) working correctly
- 100% test coverage maintained
- Production-ready code with comprehensive documentation

### Translation Quality
- High-quality Serbian output across all synsets
- Natural expressions with clear removal justifications
- Suitable for lexicographic use with curator review

### Strategic Value
- **Not a replacement** for human lexicographers
- **Complementary tool** for expanding coverage efficiently  
- **Highlights ambiguities** requiring manual sense validation
- **Accelerates workflow** by providing rich candidate pools

### Production Readiness: ✅ READY

The pipeline is ready for **pilot deployment** with:
- ✅ Curator review workflow
- ✅ Confidence-based filtering  
- ✅ Manual sense validation
- ✅ Incremental integration into existing WordNet
